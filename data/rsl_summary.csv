B25E0913 (Amsterdam Terminal) ",B25E0913 (Amsterdam Terminal) ,Netherlands,Noord-Holland,Marine Limiting,The datapoint is a marine or terrestrial limiting indicator,"Towards the top of the marine Eemian interval, the facies changes from relatively deep lagoon clays, to channelized tidal flats. The facies change is announced by gradual coarsening of the clays (second part of PAZ E5). At site Amsterdam Terminal, a channel (X-bedded sandy facies) is present, that contains reworked clasts of tidal flat levels from PAZ E6 (palynology of the mud clasts - De Gans et al. (2000:157); Van Leeuwen et al. (2000: 172 & Fig. 8). The channel sand also produced a U/Th date on a mollusc shell (species:  Venerupis aurea senescens; U/Th dating result: 118.2 +/- 6.3 ka at 29.86 m core depth. 
Van Leeuwen et al. (2000) and De Gans et al., (2000) considered this a tidal channel, contemporary to the surrounding mudflats. The alternative interpretation is that it is a fluvial channel of Early Weichselian (MIS 5c-5b-5a) stratigraphic age. Mud-drapes within foresets (diagnostic for subtidal channels, in association with reactivation surfaces) are absent in the X-bedded sands. Peeters et al. (2016) obtained luminescence dates (e.g. NCL-3208139: 102 +/- 32 ka at 32.96 m core depth; NCL-3208140: 90 +/- 22 at 33.50 m core depth). They reinterpreted the channel facies as Early Weichselian fluvial (reworking into late Eemian tidal, rather than being part of it). Still, the depth at which the only locally displaced mollusc was sampled (amidst equally reworked clay clasts) serves as the Marine Limiting indicator Marine PAZ-E6 associated marine indicator serves as a marine limiting data point. (core B25E0913 started at +1.45 surface elevation; shell depth is 28.41 m below present MSL). De Gans et al. (2000) and Zagwijn (1983) mention surrounding cores that sampled in-situ PAZ-E6 palynological tidal flat marine deposits at similar depths.

The marine deposits are capped by ~3.5 m thick loess and rest unconformably on basement rocks. A complete fauna list is provided in Table 1 and exhibits a high diversity of microfauna (<5 mm long). The assemblage is mixed seeming to result from contributions from a variety of shallow-water environments.

The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation. Up profile, they are: an unnamed sequence lignite overlain by alternating bands of andesitic tuffs and tephras and andesitic sands and sandstones (~1 m), the Manaia Lignite (~1.5 m), the Stratford Formation (~20 m), the Opunake Formation (~10 m), with tephra and tephric loess (~1.5 m) capping the cliff succession. The profile contains six informal playnological zones, Inaha Zones A, B, C, D, E, F.  A stratigraphic section is provided in Figure 2 of publication. See original paper for more detail.

The second facies was a sandstone, up to 1.5 m thick, with similar fauna content as the first facies. It was interpreted as being coastal creeks. The third facies was a beach-like sandstone with cross bedding, up to 1.5 m thick. It contained articulated  Ostrea Sp shells.

The surface extends a few hundred metres landward where it intersects a 50 m high former sea cliff mantled by colluvial sediments. Sixteen platy imbricated boulders composed of moderately sorted quartzose conglomerate, ranging in size up to 2.5 m (a-axis) and 0.2 to 1.2 m thick (c-axis), protrude c. 1 m from the seaward cliff face of the terrace, lying directly on eroded bedrock. Minimum length is ~1.7 m. Boulders have a similar orientation, almost all dipping towards the south or southwest at a mean angle of 25 degree (range 14-55 degrees). Directly landward of the boulders a well-sorted laminated sand unit overlies the bedrock occurring at similar stratigraphic level. The sand sheet is found along the terrace from the tip of the point to its landward edge, and occurs on both southern and northern sides. The laminated sand and imbricated boulders are overlain by c. 2 m of loess divisible into two units. Elevation measurement is from the contact location of boulders to shore platform, which are argued to have been emplaced by a tsunami.
The height of the LIG shoreline varies between 5 and 8 m above low water level at surveyed sites 1 km south of Oamaru, Orore Point, Kakanui and Shag Point, and Waikouaiti.

The Knights Point Terrace comprises a subhorizontal sedimentary sequence up to 11 m thick, interpreted as a deposit within a dynamic and rapidly fluctuating coast, resting unconformably on Cretaceous Arnott Basalt or Whakapohai Sandstone. Sediments range from a high-energy environment boulder bed at the base to calmer environment medium sands at the top in an overall upward-fining transgressive sequence. The uppermost surface of the marine coverbeds is interpreted as the maximum flooding surface, representing either the sea-level highstand, or when sea-level rise, relative to uplift, ceased. The inferred high-energy environment is compatible with deposition within the breaker or swash zone of a coastal beach where turbulence is at a maximum. Episodic high energy events (Facies 3, 6) are assumed to be storm waves. The bouldery lag at the base of Facies 1 is interpreted as indicating proximity of bounding sea cliffs.

Research borehole Woumen penetrates organic deposits of Eemian age. Three pollen zones are recognised, documenting the interglacial vegetational succession, starting terrestrial temperature, and developing into near-coastal (chenopodiacea nearby saltmarsh). This is collaborated with regional mapping. Other cores discussed in the paper identify older-than-Last Interglacial tidal/estuarine/fluvio-tidal/fluvial deposits (MIS-7 incisions) - but the bed highlighted here is of Last Interglacial age.

The facies change is announced by gradual coarsening of the clays (second part of PAZ E5). At site Amsterdam Terminal, a channel (X-bedded sandy facies) is present, that contains reworked clasts of tidal flat levels from PAZ E6 (palynology of the mud clasts - De Gans et al. (2000:157); Van Leeuwen et al. (2000: 172 & Fig. 8). The channel sand also produced a U/Th date on a mollusc shell (species:  Venerupis aurea senescens; U/Th dating result: 118.2 +/- 6.3 ka at 29.86 m core depth. 
Van Leeuwen et al. (2000) and De Gans et al., (2000) considered this a tidal channel, contemporary to the surrounding mudflats. The alternative interpretation is that it is a fluvial channel of Early Weichselian (MIS 5c-5b-5a) stratigraphic age. Mud-drapes within foresets (diagnostic for subtidal channels, in association with reactivation surfaces) are absent in the X-bedded sands. Peeters et al. (2016) obtained luminescence dates (e.g. NCL-3208139: 102 +/- 32 ka at 32.96 m core depth; NCL-3208140: 90 +/- 22 at 33.50 m core depth). They reinterpreted the channel facies as Early Weichselian fluvial (reworking into late Eemian tidal, rather than being part of it). Still, the depth at which the only locally displaced mollusc was sampled (amidst equally reworked clay clasts) serves as the Marine Limiting indicator Marine PAZ-E6 associated marine indicator serves as a marine limiting data point. (core B25E0913 started at +1.45 surface elevation; shell depth is 28.41 m below present MSL). De Gans et al.

Far offshore",Far offshore,Netherlands,Friesland,Sea Level Indicator,Isolation Basin (moment of marine connection),"Details are in Netherlands' geological survey internal palynological reports. The diatom report is in Dutch but they say that 44-37.40m is a freshwater lake with warves, no diatoms in 37.40-29 and then 29-25.5 was deposited in a marine littoral env. 

POLLEN:
5.15 - 12.00 m E4a (Corylus, Quercus, Alnus; stray grains of Taxus) - littoral.
12.00 - 26.70 m E3b (Quercus, Corylus, Alnus) - littoral
26.70 - 31.00 m E3a (Quercus, Alnus) <- 29.00 first marine diatoms
31.00 - 35.50 m E2b (Pinus, Quercus) - warved
35.50 - 43.40 m E2a (Pinus, Ulmus); with reworked E1 - warved
43.40 - 43.52 m E1 (Betula, Pinus) - warved 

It means that transgression occurs in E3a (relative early on). Seismics and borehole-based mapping of the surrounding should be used to establish a sill elevation along the rim of the offshore palaeo lake, presumably to the NE (analogues to transgression of the Oyster Bank sector in the Holocene), alternatively to the W. The marine-connection contact depth at the coring location, given a water depth of 40 m+- 1 (expressed versus mean sea level, not lowest astronomical tide)  is 69 +/- 1 m.  With 15 meters of fresh lacustrine clays below, some compaction correction of 6 +/- 3 meters can be assumed. At that position, the indicator is a lower limiting (marine limiting) data point of reasonable quality.  A further elevation difference between lake water level and sill saddle height is then to be included to get to a RSL elevation estimate ( 5 +/- 3 meters --first-guess-- record can be updated further ), of lower quality than the lower limiting entry.
69 - 6 = 63 +/- 3.2 m;   69 - 6 - 5 = 58 +/- 4 m (error propagation tentatively rounded)

At 28.5-30.5 meter core depth (25.6-27.6 m below MSL) is the organic pre-transgression (a lacustrine gyttja) + transgression contact (reworked clasts of peat, with a thin sand bed) interval.  It is better to consider the Amersfoort basin transgression contact an RSL-contact of Isolation Basin type, than of Basal Peat type. The peat is recognized as ex-situ at -25 m depth (below NAP/MSL), but must have been in-situ at a nearby location, probably around -19 meters (in agreement with basin fill rim architecture described in  Zagwijn 1983). In Zagwijn (1961-1983) equivalent data, palynology of the peat clasts is PAZ E3b/E4a. Palynology of the lacustrine gyttja is E2a/E3a. Long et al. (2015: Fig. 6) depict the marine-connection contact in core Amersfoort-1 at -24 to -24.5 m MSL. Palynology of the 2011 core is yet unpublished (Schokker et al. in prep.).

The most diverse molluscan assemblage is encounter between 44.40 and 46.40 (two meters upper coarse sand: moutbar top):  Other intervals studied are 46.40-48.40 (two meters medium sand: mouth bar); 48.40-48.90 (half a meter of silty loam with loam bands; deepest water); 48.90-51.9 (three meters lower coarse sands: initial transgression? fluvial sand?). 

Meijer 2002 describes the environment producing the deposits as close to sea, as the deposits contain abundant terrestrial species with some marine in-wash. The sequence is essentially a fluvio-deltaic one (upper part of Urk Fm.). The envisaged depositional environment is that of the freshwater side of Lagoon / bay head delta on the inland side of an estuary (crevasse-delta deposit filling a bay-head delta interdistributary floodbasin; deltaic subfacies within the Urk Fm.; e.g. Busschers et al., 2008).

The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top.

The paleo-channel is full of sand, fine and abundant plant remains, with an undulating structure. Superimposed on the deposits of the channel is a layer of sediments of similar composition and undulating structure, interpreted as formed in a tidal plain environment. 



Considering that the high tide level during the deposition of sediments with undulated lamination was equal to, or greater than, the maximum height of occurrence of the profile structure and that this height is 4 m in relation to the current high tide level, it can be inferred that the paleo-level of the period was ≥4 m. This value agrees with the maximum transgression (8 +/- 2 m) in the Brazilian region according to the records of various marine terraces.

Type Section",Type Section,New Zealand (Aotearoa),Taranaki,Sea Level Indicator,Beach deposit or beachrock,"Type section location, 450 m west of the Inaha Stream mouth. The shore platform, at the base of the section, is marked by an angular unconformity formed on the Plionce Tangahoe Formation, 2 m above the modern high-water mark . The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation. Up profile, they are: an unnamed sequence lignite overlain by alternating bands of andesitic tuffs and tephras and andesitic sands and sandstones (~1 m), the Manaia Lignite (~1.5 m), the Stratford Formation (~20 m), the Opunake Formation (~10 m), with tephra and tephric loess (~1.5 m) capping the cliff succession. The profile contains six informal playnological zones, Inaha Zones A, B, C, D, E, F.  A stratigraphic section is provided in Figure 2 of publication. See original paper for more detail.

The exposure is an unknown distance seaward of the inner terrace margin and located near to a marine cliff cut into the marine terrace sequence. Eleven lithologies (identified alphabetically as 'b' through 'l' up profile) are found overlying the unconformity of the shore platform. Units 'b' through 'd' comprise a fining upward marine sequence with 'd' hosting marine sponge spicules. 'e' and 'f' are a conglomerate and pebbly sand with wood fragments, respectively and although likely near-marine, depositional environment is uncertain. 'g' is labelled Otaki Sandstone. 'h' through 'j' are sandy gravel, clay, and lignite with wood. 'k' is additional Otaki Sandstone unconformably overlain by glacial solifluction sediments. While Te Punga describes the lithology, no effort is made to interpret the sequence and it is later summarized by Fleming (1972) as consisting of marine beach gravels and sands of a transgressive high-level sea, beach-derived micaceous dune sands that advanced as the sea retreated, and lignite deposited in swamps ponded by the dunes. It is backed by an old cliff-line. The marine sediments and dune sands are known collectively as the Otaki Formation, with the dune sands referred to as the Otaki Sandstone. 
Because the transition from sub-aqueous to terrestrial deposits is uncertain, and given the uknown distance from the inner margin, the unit containing the sponge spicules is used as a marine-limiting indicator.

The terrace is well developed and bordered by distinctive sea cliffs. The terrace surface is underlain by well-rounded marine gravel about 3 m thick, unconformably overlying a horizontal abrasion platform in Tertiary limestone. The original terrace surface is well preserved, although now partly covered by secondary deposits of loess and slope wash. The altitude of marine gravels ranges from ~45-35 m near the former shoreline. The elevation provided here is of the contact between the abrasion surface formed in bedrock and the beach gravels as observed along the sea cliff and as drawn in stratigraphic section (Figure 3B). 

Multiple columnar sections of the terraces are drawn in this paper, however specific measurements above sea level are not provided and description in text can differ some from drawn section; e.g. height, thickness of deposit. The region description was subdivided into sections, the most representative description of the terrace for each section has been entered into the database.

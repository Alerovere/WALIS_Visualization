Beneath the terrace surface there are fossiliferous marine deposits (2.5 m thick) previously described by McKay (1877, 1886) and Fleming & Suggate (1964). The marine deposits are capped by ~3.5 m thick loess and rest unconformably on basement rocks. A complete fauna list is provided in Table 1 and exhibits a high diversity of microfauna (<5 mm long). The assemblage is mixed seeming to result from contributions from a variety of shallow-water environments. Surprisingly the fauna indicates a cold temperature regime and is similar to that living in shallow water at present, no farther north than Foveaux Strait.

The elevation of the bedrock strath at this point was taken as equivalent to an inner edge. However; lat/long coordinates were not provided for this measurement, only for sample locations an unknown distance seaward from the inner margin from which lat/long and elevation information is derived.

shore platform",shore platform,New Zealand (Aotearoa),Otago,Marine Limiting,The datapoint is a marine or terrestrial limiting indicator,"Marine sand and boulders deposited on an MIS 5 eroded bedrock surface cut into carbonaceous mudstone. The surface extends a few hundred metres landward where it intersects a 50 m high former sea cliff mantled by colluvial sediments. Sixteen platy imbricated boulders composed of moderately sorted quartzose conglomerate, ranging in size up to 2.5 m (a-axis) and 0.2 to 1.2 m thick (c-axis), protrude c. 1 m from the seaward cliff face of the terrace, lying directly on eroded bedrock. Minimum length is ~1.7 m. Boulders have a similar orientation, almost all dipping towards the south or southwest at a mean angle of 25 degree (range 14-55 degrees). Directly landward of the boulders a well-sorted laminated sand unit overlies the bedrock occurring at similar stratigraphic level. The sand sheet is found along the terrace from the tip of the point to its landward edge, and occurs on both southern and northern sides. The laminated sand and imbricated boulders are overlain by c. 2 m of loess divisible into two units. Elevation measurement is from the contact location of boulders to shore platform, which are argued to have been emplaced by a tsunami.
The height of the LIG shoreline varies between 5 and 8 m above low water level at surveyed sites 1 km south of Oamaru, Orore Point, Kakanui and Shag Point, and Waikouaiti.

The surface increases in altitude eastwards for at least 1.5 km, where it occurs somewhere between 15 and 20 m above hwm (this height is derived from Figure 4, a stratigraphic section of the coastline). The platform is directly overlain by a shellbed then laminated marine sands (of unkown thicknesses), in turn overlain by other terrestrial deposits. 
Because the thickness of the shellbed nor any description of the fossil assemblage is provided, the elevation recorded here is of the shore platform. The elevation provided is NOT from the inland margin, where the shoreline would have been located.

The exposure is an unknown distance seaward of the inner terrace margin and located near to a marine cliff cut into the marine terrace sequence. Eleven lithologies (identified alphabetically as 'b' through 'l' up profile) are found overlying the unconformity of the shore platform. Units 'b' through 'd' comprise a fining upward marine sequence with 'd' hosting marine sponge spicules. 'e' and 'f' are a conglomerate and pebbly sand with wood fragments, respectively and although likely near-marine, depositional environment is uncertain. 'g' is labelled Otaki Sandstone. 'h' through 'j' are sandy gravel, clay, and lignite with wood. 'k' is additional Otaki Sandstone unconformably overlain by glacial solifluction sediments. While Te Punga describes the lithology, no effort is made to interpret the sequence and it is later summarized by Fleming (1972) as consisting of marine beach gravels and sands of a transgressive high-level sea, beach-derived micaceous dune sands that advanced as the sea retreated, and lignite deposited in swamps ponded by the dunes. It is backed by an old cliff-line. The marine sediments and dune sands are known collectively as the Otaki Formation, with the dune sands referred to as the Otaki Sandstone. 
Because the transition from sub-aqueous to terrestrial deposits is uncertain, and given the uknown distance from the inner margin, the unit containing the sponge spicules is used as a marine-limiting indicator.

The shore platform, at the base of the section, is marked by an angular unconformity formed on the Plionce Tangahoe Formation, 2 m above the modern high-water mark . The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation. Up profile, they are: an unnamed sequence lignite overlain by alternating bands of andesitic tuffs and tephras and andesitic sands and sandstones (~1 m), the Manaia Lignite (~1.5 m), the Stratford Formation (~20 m), the Opunake Formation (~10 m), with tephra and tephric loess (~1.5 m) capping the cliff succession. The profile contains six informal playnological zones, Inaha Zones A, B, C, D, E, F.  A stratigraphic section is provided in Figure 2 of publication. See original paper for more detail.

Type Section",Type Section,New Zealand (Aotearoa),Taranaki,Sea Level Indicator,Beach deposit or beachrock,"Type section location, 450 m west of the Inaha Stream mouth. The shore platform, at the base of the section, is marked by an angular unconformity formed on the Plionce Tangahoe Formation, 2 m above the modern high-water mark . The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation.

The marine limiting indicator is positioned where the  landward marine cliff of the LIG Otaki Terrace is cut into a MIS 6 fluvial terrace. The cliff is blanketed by dunes but the associated beach sands are described as occurring in the region at ~30 m amsl.
The marine units were designated the Otaki Terrace by Palmer et al 1988 on the basis that they could trace the terrace surface from Otaki near continuously to the Whanganui Sequence, where it was correlated to the Tokomaru Terrace.  The seaward margin of the terrace has at least two more narrow treads ""preserved a few km north of Otaki"", possibly MIS 5c and 5a.

The shore platform, at the base of the section, is marked by an angular unconformity formed on the Plionce Tangahoe Formation, 2 m above the modern high-water mark . The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation. Up profile, they are: an unnamed sequence lignite overlain by alternating bands of andesitic tuffs and tephras and andesitic sands and sandstones (~1 m), the Manaia Lignite (~1.5 m), the Stratford Formation (~20 m), the Opunake Formation (~10 m), with tephra and tephric loess (~1.5 m) capping the cliff succession. The profile contains six informal playnological zones, Inaha Zones A, B, C, D, E, F.  A stratigraphic section is provided in Figure 2 of publication. See original paper for more detail.

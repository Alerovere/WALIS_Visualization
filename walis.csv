The paleo-channel is full of sand, fine and abundant plant remains, with an undulating structure. Superimposed on the deposits of the channel is a layer of sediments of similar composition and undulating structure, interpreted as formed in a tidal plain environment.
Considering that the high tide level during the deposition of sediments with undulated lamination was equal to, or greater than, the maximum height of occurrence of the profile structure and that this height is 4 m in relation to the current high tide level, it can be inferred that the paleo-level of the period was ≥4 m.

The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution.

The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix. The gravels are 90% hard hornblende-augite andesites and 10% much softer sandstones eroded from the Pliocene strata beneath. These sandstones are extensively bored by worms and molluscs and contain fossils of the date mussel Lithophaga (Zelithophaga) truncata (Gray). Above the basal gravel unit is 1.87 m of soft, weakly cross-laminated, predominantly andesitic sand with minor granules, pebbles, and cobbles that fine upwards and are extremely weathered and iron stained at top. This is granular medium sand, moderately to poorly sorted with near-symmetrical leptokurtic grain-size distribution. 
Elevation is provided for the package of sandy beach sediments.
An ~34 m thick sequence of volcaniclastic beds with interbedded lignites overlie the marine/beach sediments of the Inaha Formation. Up profile, they are: an unnamed sequence lignite overlain by alternating bands of andesitic tuffs and tephras and andesitic sands and sandstones (~1 m), the Manaia Lignite (~1.5 m), the Stratford Formation (~20 m), the Opunake Formation (~10 m), with tephra and tephric loess (~1.5 m) capping the cliff succession. The profile contains six informal playnological zones, Inaha Zones A, B, C, D, E, F.  A stratigraphic section is provided in Figure 2 of publication. See original paper for more detail.

The shore platform, at the base of the section, is marked by an angular unconformity formed on the Plionce Tangahoe Formation, 2 m above the modern high-water mark . The unconformity is sharp and planar with a small angular discordance. The erosion surface dips 3 degree to the WSW and is traced several hundred metres westwards before dipping below present sea level. To the east it gradually rises to 8 m above the high water mark immediately west of the mouth of Waingogoro River, where truncated by fluvial deposits. 
The overlying marine deposits are identified as the Inaha Formation, defined as dominantly andesitic sands and gravels presumed to extend 3-4 km inland to the Inaha Marine Cliff, which marks the shoreline at formation. The Inaha Formation sediments indicate near-shore marine and beach origin and are overlain by additional terrestrial deposits. Overlying the unconformity is a 0.3 m thick gravel unit comprising rounded and subrounded boulders, up to 0.74 m diameter, in a pebble and cobble matrix.

Waterfall Stream Section",Waterfall Stream Section,New Zealand (Aotearoa),Wellington,Marine Limiting,The datapoint is a marine or terrestrial limiting indicator,"Section stratigraphy of a marine terrace upon a wave-cut surface. The exposure is an unknown distance seaward of the inner terrace margin and located near to a marine cliff cut into the marine terrace sequence. Eleven lithologies (identified alphabetically as 'b' through 'l' up profile) are found overlying the unconformity of the shore platform. Units 'b' through 'd' comprise a fining upward marine sequence with 'd' hosting marine sponge spicules. 'e' and 'f' are a conglomerate and pebbly sand with wood fragments, respectively and although likely near-marine, depositional environment is uncertain. 'g' is labelled Otaki Sandstone. 'h' through 'j' are sandy gravel, clay, and lignite with wood. 'k' is additional Otaki Sandstone unconformably overlain by glacial solifluction sediments. While Te Punga describes the lithology, no effort is made to interpret the sequence and it is later summarized by Fleming (1972) as consisting of marine beach gravels and sands of a transgressive high-level sea, beach-derived micaceous dune sands that advanced as the sea retreated, and lignite deposited in swamps ponded by the dunes. It is backed by an old cliff-line. The marine sediments and dune sands are known collectively as the Otaki Formation, with the dune sands referred to as the Otaki Sandstone. 
Because the transition from sub-aqueous to terrestrial deposits is uncertain, and given the uknown distance from the inner margin, the unit containing the sponge spicules is used as a marine-limiting indicator.

The sand sheet is found along the terrace from the tip of the point to its landward edge, and occurs on both southern and northern sides.

Okarahia Stream to Conway River Section, Columnar Section 6","Okarahia Stream to Conway River Section, Columnar Section 6",New Zealand (Aotearoa),Canterbury,Marine Limiting,The datapoint is a marine or terrestrial limiting indicator,"Columnar Section 6 of Amuri Bluff Terrace, Okarahia Stream to Conway River area. The terrace is discontinuous in this region and bordered by gentle slopes up to ~10 m in height, which descend to the fluvial Claverley Terrace surfaces. The exposed section is typical and shows 10 m of well-sorted and stratified beach gravels unconformably overlying bedrock. The upper surface of marine deposits near the former shoreline is ~60 m asl (drawn at ~63 m in publication) with no overlying sediments.

Multiple columnar sections of the terraces are drawn in this paper, however specific measurements above sea level are not provided and description in text can differ some from drawn section; e.g. height, thickness of deposit. The region description was subdivided into sections, the most representative section of the terrace has been entered into the database. The substrate on which the shore platform has formed undulates significantly and the thickness of marine deposits also differs significantly, i.e. multiple meters. The terraces in general show an increase of uplift to the south.",Photogrammetric methods or aneroid altimeter,50,5,,,,,,Mean Sea Level / General definition,,,Other age constraint,Equal to,MIS 5 Terrace Correlation,,,,,,,,,130,71,Equal to,MIS 5,3,1,"Ota et al., 1984

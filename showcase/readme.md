**PALSEA - SERCE 2021 (Poster Session)**

In this poster we present WALIS-Explorer, an R-Shiny application to visualize the sea-level index points and limiting data available in WALIS. With WALIS-explorer, we aim to create an easily accessible entry point to explore sea-level data and serve as an academic tool for sea-level concepts. 

This application allows users to rapidly visualize sea-level indicators from different parts of the world without coding skills or download the dataset. The application includes filtering options by age, relative sea level, and geographical parameters (e.g., dating technique and vertical uncertainty of measurements), relative sea-level graphs, geo visualizations of indicators, and summary tables with complementary information.
